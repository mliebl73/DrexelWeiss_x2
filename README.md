# DrexelWeiss_x2

This is my Drexel & Weiss integration into Home Assistant leveraging Node-RED to handle the input/output from/to the USB / Serial interface directly plugged in to my raspberry pi.

Thanks to ikewestbrook from the home assistant community for the initial Node-RED implementation, that I based my work on.

I did not try to re-integrate the files into an empty HASS installation, so no guarantee this will work right out of the box. But I am happy to share whatever would be missing ;)
